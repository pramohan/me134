## Game Design
The project is based off of the game Operation. In this game, there is a board with cutouts of various shapes, each with matching game pieces that fit into the corresponding cutouts. In the classic version of the game, the goal is to remove all of the pieces from their cutouts without the player or the pieces touching the cutout edges.

Our game is a variation on Operation in which the player controls a robotic arm to remove or insert the pieces from the game board. In leveraging a robotic arm, we are also able to autonomously insert and remove pieces from the board. As such, the goal is to make a fully functional game in which the robot can autonomously control the board state, as well as respond to manual commands from a user operating a control box.
